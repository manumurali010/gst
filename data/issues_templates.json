                "brief_facts": "For the period {{period}}, the outward taxable supply declared in GSTR-1 amounts to ₹{{gstr1_taxable}}, whereas the outward taxable supply declared in GSTR-3B amounts to ₹{{gstr3b_taxable}}. This results in a difference of ₹{{value_difference}}. The corresponding tax difference amounts to ₹{{tax_difference}}.",
                "grounds": "The taxpayer is required to report outward supplies consistently in both GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. The detected mismatch indicates short declaration of outward taxable supplies in GSTR-3B, resulting in short payment of tax.",
                "legal": "Section 59 of the CGST Act mandates self-assessment of tax, while Section 75(12) provides that tax declared in returns must be paid. Any underreported liability in GSTR-3B compared to GSTR-1 is recoverable as self-assessed tax.",
                "conclusion": "In view of the above facts and legal provisions, differential tax of ₹{{tax_difference}} along with applicable interest is payable. The taxpayer is required to furnish justification or discharge the liability accordingly."
