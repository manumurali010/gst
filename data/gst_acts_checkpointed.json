If a User transmits illegal or improper information to another User, we might be blamed even though we did nothing more than unknowingly carry the message from one User to another. Accordingly, we need all Users to accept responsibility for their own acts, and to accept that an act by another User that damages them must not be blamed on us, but only on the other User.\nAlthough it is the goal of AdvocateKhoj.com to provide Users with reliable and quality systems, we may make mistakes or experience system failure from time to time. Such problems are inevitable in operating a system of this size.

Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability\nA great danger for AdvocateKhoj.com, and for all operators of online systems, is that we might be held accountable for the wrongful actions of our Users.

If a User uploads a program with a computer virus, and the other Users' computers are damaged, we might be blamed even though a User left the virus on our System. If a User transmits illegal or improper information to another User, we might be blamed even though we did nothing more than unknowingly carry the message from one User to another. Accordingly, we need all Users to accept responsibility for their own acts, and to accept that an act by another User that damages them must not be blamed on us, but only on the other User.\nAlthough it is the goal of AdvocateKhoj.com to provide Users with reliable and quality systems, we may make mistakes or experience system failure from time to time. Such problems are inevitable in operating a system of this size. We would not be able to make this system available to Users if we had to accept blame or financial liability for any usability problems, system failures or errors, or mistakes or damages of any kind. In order to continue offering and improving our service, AdvocateKhoj.com must deny any warranties on this service and insure that our liability for any problems connected with the use of our system is strictly limited.\nThese needs are accomplished by the following disclaimers:\nDisclaimer of Warranties\nTHE USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT THE USER'S SOLE RISK.

Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability\nA great danger for AdvocateKhoj.com, and for all operators of online systems, is that we might be held accountable for the wrongful actions of our Users. If one User libels another User, the injured User might blame us, even though the first User was really at fault. If a User uploads a program with a computer virus, and the other Users' computers are damaged, we might be blamed even though a User left the virus on our System. If a User transmits illegal or improper information to another User, we might be blamed even though we did nothing more than unknowingly carry the message from one User to another. Accordingly, we need all Users to accept responsibility for their own acts, and to accept that an act by another User that damages them must not be blamed on us, but only on the other User.\nAlthough it is the goal of AdvocateKhoj.com to provide Users with reliable and quality systems, we may make mistakes or experience system failure from time to time. Such problems are inevitable in operating a system of this size. We would not be able to make this system available to Users if we had to accept blame or financial liability for any usability problems, system failures or errors, or mistakes or damages of any kind. In order to continue offering and improving our service, AdvocateKhoj.com must deny any warranties on this service and insure that our liability for any problems connected with the use of our system is strictly limited.\nThese needs are accomplished by the following disclaimers:\nDisclaimer of Warranties\nTHE USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT THE USER'S SOLE RISK.
